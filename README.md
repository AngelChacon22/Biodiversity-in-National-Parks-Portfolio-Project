# **Biodiversity in National Parks [Portfolio Project]**

## **Introduction:**
This project was performed for the machine learning speciality in CodeCademy. The data was provided by CodeCademy and contained
data collected on U.S. national parks. The data was contained in two csv files (observations.csv & species_info.csv). The data was 
cleaned, analyzed, and plotted using a jupyter notebook and focused on answering four questions provided by Codecademy:
- What is the disribution of conservation_status for animals?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are difference between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which species were spotted the most at each park?
